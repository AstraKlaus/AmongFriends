# New Settings Interface for Among Us Bot

We've implemented a modern, button-based interface for adjusting your game settings. Instead of typing commands, you can now easily change settings with just a few clicks!

## How it Works

When you type `/settings` in the chat with the bot, you'll see an interface like this:

```
üéÆ Lobby Settings for RPVHZF

üîß Game Configuration:
‚Ä¢ Impostors: 1
‚Ä¢ Tasks per Player: 3
‚Ä¢ Emergency Meetings: 1
‚Ä¢ Kill Cooldown: 45s

‚è± Time Controls:
‚Ä¢ Discussion Time: 90s
‚Ä¢ Voting Time: 60s

Use the buttons below to adjust settings
```

Below this message, you'll see a set of buttons for each setting:

- **‚ûñ [Setting Name: Value] ‚ûï** - Click minus to decrease, plus to increase

For example:
- **‚ûñ Impostors: 1 ‚ûï**
- **‚ûñ Tasks per Player: 3 ‚ûï**
- **‚ûñ Emergency Meetings: 1 ‚ûï**

At the bottom, you'll find control buttons:
- **‚Ü©Ô∏è Reset Defaults** - Reset all settings to their default values
- **‚úÖ Save & Close** - Save your settings and close the menu

## Benefits

1. **User-Friendly**: No need to remember command syntax
2. **Error-Free**: Can't make typing mistakes anymore
3. **Quick Adjustments**: Instantly see the effect of your changes
4. **Clear Limits**: Buttons automatically disable when you reach min/max values

Simply use `/settings` to open this menu and adjust your game as needed!
